Peer-and-Group-Evaluation-in-Classroom
======================================

In normal classroom interaction there will be a teacher who monitors and organizes the activities. The teacher will divide the students into the groups and organizes the quizes to test their understanding of the material which was taught in the class. But, this organization of quizes to manage and to monitor each individual's performance in the class tends to be harder. To resolve this problem we are presenting a new solution of evaluating the students performance which will also provide a complete report of them automatically to the teacher.
