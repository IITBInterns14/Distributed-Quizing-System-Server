Classroom Evaluation System
======================================

### Welcome to this Repository. This is the project repo that i have developed at IIT Bombay during my Summer Internship.

##### It has 2 branches - master, serverWithGUI. Second one is same as the former one with GUI features and fixed bugs

Feel free to access the code. Check out the Client code at [Quizzing system Client](https://github.com/vamshireddy/Distributed-Quizing-System-Client)

* This is the GUI version of the Quizzing System server.
* I have used Netbeans to design the Server GUI in Java.
